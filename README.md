Small Business Performance & Profitability Analysis ðŸ“Š
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI

This project presents a complete performance and profitability analysis for my small crochet business. It combines Python-based data wrangling and visualizations in Jupyter Notebook with interactive dashboards in Power BI to deliver actionable insights.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
Data Cleaning: Standardized item and customer names, parsed working time, and handled missing/inconsistent values.

Feature Engineering: Calculated labor cost based on time spent and hourly rate; derived net profit per order.

Visual Analysis (Jupyter):

Top customers by profit, revenue, and number of orders

Most profitable products and sales trends

Gender-based profitability insights

Interactive Dashboards (Power BI):

Total & average profit by item and customer

Cost structure breakdown (material, labor, etc.)

Sales pattern analysis by gender and order frequency

ðŸŽ¯ Project Impact
The analysis enabled clear visibility into which products and customers contribute most to revenue and profit. By identifying trends in gender-based spending and order patterns, the dashboards support more targeted business decisionsâ€”improving pricing strategy, production planning, and customer engagement.
